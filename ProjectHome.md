HMA Architecture Working Group

This Google Web Toolkit and WorldWind application provides a web interface to a satellite sensor (eg for Earth Observation) planning system.

Based on the OGC standard:
  * OGC 10-135 Sensor Planning Service Interface Standard 2.0 Earth Observation Satellite Tasking Extension

The HMA Projects are overviewed by the HMA Architecture Working Group HMA AWG and the Ground Segment Coordination Body (GSCB). Information about the Heterogeneous Missions Access Architecture Working Group and related meetings is available at the HMA AWG page.

The GSCB was created to ensure that contributions to GMES adopt a common, coordinated and cost-effective approach that responds to the needs of Earth observation users. View the GSCB Report 2009
